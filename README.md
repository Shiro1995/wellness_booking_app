# Wellness Booking App

This is a simple repository for building a mobile app by React Native framework. It follows the requirement in the coding challenge of my interview.

## How To Use?

After cloning the repository, get all project-dependencies by running the command above at terminal:
```
 yarn install
```
Then run app on the simulator or your real-device.

 yarn android
```
